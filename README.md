# Codewars Katas

This repository is where I track my daily Codewars kata solutions for both Java and TypeScript.

## ðŸ’¡ Workflow

- Each kata solution is developed in its own branch.
- After writing and testing the solution, I commit and push the branch.
- Once reviewed, the branch is merged into `main` to keep the history clean.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `java/` â€“ Java-based solutions with simple test files (JUnit 4).
- `typescript/` â€“ TypeScript solutions with basic test cases using Jest-style structure.

## ðŸ§  About Codewars

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a platform for improving coding skills through short algorithm challenges (called "katas") ranked by difficulty.

This repo helps me:

- Build discipline through consistent daily problem solving
- Practice test-driven development (TDD)
- Sharpen language-specific syntax and algorithmic thinking
