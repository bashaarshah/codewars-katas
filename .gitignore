 # --- Specific to YOUR setup (Manual JARs in lib) ---
 # If you manually add JARs to a 'lib' folder AND want to track them in Git,
 # DO NOT add a rule that ignores the lib folder.
 # If you added the JAR to lib/ and want Git to track it, make sure
 # you do NOT have a line like:
 # lib/
 # or
 # *.jar
 # (unless you specifically re-include JARs in lib, which is more complex)
 # Since you likely want to track lib/ and its contents, just don't add an ignore rule for it.
